# GradientShapes

## The program

The program starts with 3 points (n = 3) and will create a gradient triangle between those points.
Right now the only available gradient shape is a triangle. It will not work for any other `n`.
By default the shape won't move. However the triangle will adapt to movements.

## Outlook

Further shapes will be available in a gradient setting.
